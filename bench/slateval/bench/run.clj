  "Benchmarks for slateval.

   Two kinds of benchmarks:

   - Transaction benchmarks (`add-*`, `init`, `retract-5`) replay all
     transactions against a fresh store on every iteration, because a db
     snapshot cannot be transacted against once its store has moved on.
     They run with `*batch*` 1; benches that commit one transaction per
     operation use the tiny `*people100` dataset, since a SlateDB commit
     flushes durably (~100ms each). Note: every iteration creates a
     temporary SlateDB store.

   - Query/read benchmarks build a store once and only read from it."
